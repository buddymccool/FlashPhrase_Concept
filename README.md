# FlashPhrase_Concept
Proof of concept for Python-based language practicing app. Uses a list of ~200 most commonly used words in selected language.

On initializing, choose a language. If you have practiced that language before with this app, the data pulled in will be only the words you listed as not knowing by hitting the red X button. Using the green checkmark box will remove that word from the created words-to-learn file.

All translations provided by Google Tanslate. The accuracy of these translations could not be verified by me and so the accuracy may vary.
Sources for the most commonly used words in each language from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists

Future iterations are planned to include basic phrases in addition common words. More languages and verified translations are to be deployed.
